## Brief introduction

This project was inspired by the world-famous card game Hearthstone by Blizzard Entertainment
however, it is heavily simplified. The game uses Java Swing as the main module for GUI. The goal of this
game is to defeat your opponent through building a strong deck of cards and attacking the opposing
hero.

## User manual

The whole game is controlled only by mouse, whenever the player wants to play a card, they simply click
on a card that they want to play onto the board. Current player that is on turn is always at the bottom of
the screen. Board is divided into two parts, the top part is for player no. 2, and the bottom part is for the
first player.
Combat begins by selecting a deployed card on board and then clicking on the target card. End turn is
self-explanatory player clicks on the button and the turn ends.
There are 5 types of cards – minion, buff, spell, AoE spell, taunt. These types closely resemble the
original types of cards found in Hearthstone.
Minion is a basic unit, that can attack other cards.
Buff is a type of minion that can increase other minion’s stats.
Spell is a non-minion card that the player can use to inflict damage.
AoE spell is a spell that can hit multiple enemies.
Taunt is a type of minion that protects the hero from being attack by other minions.
